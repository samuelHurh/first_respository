# first_respository
This is my first repository and I am using it to discover what github is and how I can use it.
This is an edit that I did on another branch that I will soon be committing to main.

About me: I am a Systems Engineering and Design major at UIUC's Grainger school of engineering. I have an interest in focusing my studies on software programming and design during the later years of my college career. At this point I have no idea what jobs I should be looking for.
